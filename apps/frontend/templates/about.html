    <h2>About Alphabits</h2>
    <p>Alphabits started in the summer 2007. In the beginning the focus was mainly on graphic design and web <em>design</em>. I pretty soon realised that my strength was in technical problem solving, and maybe not so much creative, visual problem solving, so as time has passed, Alphabits has become a software company.</p>
    <p>It has never been my intention to try to expand Alphabits, and maybe get an employee. Instead Alphabits has been my way, to work on exactly the jobs I wanted, at the time I wanted. It haven't made me rich, but I have learned a great deal about running a bussiness.</p>
